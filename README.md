![HQNN-AMINE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1238172-59f7-43ff-9bc8-545b4940ffce)

**Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Variational Quantum Regressor** are one of iterative quantum neural network (QNN) algorithms in quantum machine learning (QML) to enhacne quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling for CO<sub>2</sub>-captuing amine solvents.

All source codes will be uploaded after acceptance.
